Binary Trees
Each node has atmost 2 children

-> Full Binary Tree : Each node has either 0 or 2 children
-> Complete Binary Tree : All levels are completely filled except the last level, the last level has all nodes as left as possible
-> Perfect Binary Tree : All leaf nodes are at the same level
-> Balanced Binary Tree : Height of the tree should be at max log(N) where N is the number of nodes
-> Degenerate Tree : Every node has a single child
